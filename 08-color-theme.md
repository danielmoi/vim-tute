# Color Theme

Let's just pick one now
vim-colors-solarized

Add this to `.vimrc`
```
Plug 'altercation/vim-colors-solarized'
```



Save, reload, and run PlugInstall

Nothing has changed...
We need to set the colorscheme.

We need set a generic dark background
```
set background=dark " Use a dark background 
```

Tell Vim to use the solarized color scheme
```
colorscheme solarized " Use solarized color scheme
```

Save and reload!
