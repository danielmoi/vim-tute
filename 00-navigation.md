Welcome to navigation!

Let's learn how to move around in Vim using only keystrokes!


### By character
```
Down  j
Up    k
Left  h
Right l
```


Another way of visualising it:

```
             UP

             k
LEFT     h       l   RIGHT
             j

            DOWN
```


Yet another way:
```
                      UP
                      |
    LEFT --   h   j   k   l  -- RIGHT
                  |
                DOWN
```



### By word
NB. these will take us to the beginning of the word
```
w         next word
b         previous word     Back one word

```

### By page
```
CTRL-F    Forward one page
CTRL-B    Back one page
```

### Top / bottom
```
gg        Top of file
G         End of file
```
