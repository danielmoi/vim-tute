# Customization

## Your turn!
The most recent configuration - NERDTree - is a good example of why it's almost time to say
goodbye!

Those settings I shared configures NERDTree in a way that _I_ find useful.

You may think differently!

In fact, if at any stage you found yourself saying "Why
are we doing this? Wouldn't it be better like this?", then you have ascertained a
fundamental principle behind Vim.

It's about configuring Vim for your own personal use.

I will share a few more tips and then it's over to you!

## Vimrc
A good place to start your customization is with the layout of your `.vimrc` file.

As we've gone on, we've added comments, and headings to separate different sections.

Start making your `.vimrc` your personal Vim configuration file!


For example, do you prefer having your comments on separate lines...
```
" Show line numbers
set number
```
... or on a single line?
```
set number " Show line numbers
```

... or with a date stamp?
```
set number " Show line numbers [171225]
```

Again, do you prefer your sections like this...
```
" === SETTINGS ========================================
" set number
```

... or like this?
```
" *** SETTINGS ***
" set number
```

... or do you prefer not to have sections at all?
