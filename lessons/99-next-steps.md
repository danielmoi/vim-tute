# Next Steps

## Tips
- it will take time getting used to using the Motion keys!
(`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, for up left, down, up, right)
- don't only navigate by CHARACTER (`h`, `l` for left, right)
  - use `w` and `b` to navigate by WORD!
  - don't worry too much about `e` for now - it can get confusing!
- suddenly made a mistake? `<Escape>`
- there's also `u` (Undo) and `<C-r>` (Redo)
- invest in learning how to [touch-type](https://www.typing.com)
- practice taking notes in Vim
  - use markdown `.md` files
  - this removes the complexity of setting up code formatting etc
- learn the capabilities of Vim, instead of adding plugins all the time

- navigation is about the CURSOR position, relative to the PAGE (current view port on the file)

## Integrate
One of the best ways to become more familiar with using the keyboard (instead of the
mouse / trackpad) is to integrate keystrokes into your daily workflow.

- Visual Studio Code
  - https://code.visualstudio.com/
  - a REALLY great, free, open-source code editor from Microsoft
  - comes with an excellent [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) for Vim
  - VSCode + Vim extension is my current setup for work - I feel that my familiarity / setup with
  Vim is not productive enough yet for work
- Web browsers
  - both Chrome and Firefox have a Vimium extension
  - it provides keyboard shortcuts for navigation and control, using the same Vim mappings
  - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/
  - Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en
