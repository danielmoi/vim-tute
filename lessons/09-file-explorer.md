# File Explorer

Now we will look at browsing through files and directories in Vim.



---
## Explore
Let's open Vim's File Explorer window:

```
:Explore
```

You should see something similar to this:

![File Explorer](screenshots/vim-netrw.png)


This is the Netrw plugin that ships with Vim and is the default filebrowser.

We can use the up and down keys to navigate, and then `<Enter>` to open the file or
directory under the cursor.


---
## NERDTree
We will install another plugin, NERDTree, which provides a good filebrowser interface. This
is not crucial - you can configure Netrw to provide a similar experience. You can read about
that [here](https://shapeshed.com/vim-netrw/).

Let's add NERDTree to our list of plugins:
```
Plug 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
```
![Vimrc for NERDTree](screenshots/vimrc-nerdtree.png)


Again, we need to save, reload, run :PlugInstall, and reload again.

Now, we can open NERDTree:
```
:NERDTree
```

You should see something similar to this:
![NERDTree](screenshots/vim-nerdtree.png)

My current directory is the Git repo for this tutorial - you should see the directory
tree for _your_ current directory.

Similar to Netrw, we can navigate using Motion commands, and open files / directories
under the cursor position.


---
## Leader
Before we configure NERDTree, we will set up a `Leader` key for Vim.

A leader key allows us to create new key SEQUENCES.

The default `leader` in Vim is the backslash `\`, but we will use the comma `,` key in this tutorial.

Let's add this to our `.vimrc`:
```
" Use the comma key as the leader
let mapleader = ","
```

---
## Customize NERDTree
Now, with our leader key all set up, add the following lines to our `.vimrc`:

```
" === NERDTree ==================================
" Toggle NERDTreeToggle
map <C-n> :NERDTreeToggle<Enter>
noremap <Leader>n :NERDTreeToggle<Enter>

" Focus NERDTree
noremap <Leader>f :NERDTreeFind<Enter>

" show hidden files
let NERDTreeShowHidden=1

" close vim if NERDTree is the only thing left
autocmd bufenter * if (winnr("$") == 1 && exists("b:NERDTree") && b:NERDTree.isTabTree()) | q | endif
```

Don't forget to save and `source`!

With `<Leader>n` mapped to toggling NERDTree, the key sequence `,n` will also toggle NERDTree.

The other things achieved by those settings are explained by their accompanying comments.
